Log of incremental changes to Spike Train Communities Toolbox

v1.2 (12/6/2011)

* [Bug fix] cluster_spike_data_bins.m, cluster_spike_data_binless.m: fixed error where choosing the rectified correlation 
	coefficient option was unlikely to give any groups, because the resulting similarity matrix had 1s on the diagonal.
	Now choosing this option gives similar, occasionally better, performance than 'cosine'.
 
* [New feature] cluster_spike_data_bins.m, cluster_spike_data_binless.m: a new form of the analysis - if opts.blnGrph=1 
	is selected, an undirected network (each entry a 0 or 1) is constructed, where each link corresponds to a 
	significantly similar pair of spike-trains. The clustering algorithm is then run on this network. Significance is 
	determined using a permutation test: a specified number of shuffled spike-train data-sets are created to obtain
	p-values for each link. This option is useful for separating small N, long-period data-sets of noisy data. 
	[Note that the memory requirements for this option are extensive, and depend on the number of permutations specified]


* [New function] shuffle_intervals.m: given a spike-train data-set, creates a shuffled surrogate data-set in which each train 
	is replaced with an ISI-shuffled version of itself. This maintains the same first-order (mean and variance) statistics 
	of each spike-train, but disrupts correlations between trains.


v1.1 (11/5/2011)

* [Bug fix] cluster_spike_data_bins.m: fixed error where, if overlapping option used (opts.overlap > 0), the width of bin was 
	set to the fraction of overlapping specified. Is now correctly set to the appropriate binsize.

* [New feature] cluster_spike_data_bins.m, cluster_spike_data_binless.m: new option parameter, opts.blnS. If set to 1, 
	will construct all similarity matrices, but will not run the clustering algorithm (the matrices can be returned 
	in the existing optional output argument Sxy - see functions for help). This option is useful for e.g. reconstructing 
	the similarity matrix after have done the groupings.
 

* [New feature] plot_clusters.m: new optional argument CMAP. This argument specifies the MATLAB colormap to use when 
	colour-coding each of the groups. This can be specified as either a string corresponding to one of MATLAB's 
	built-in colormaps, or a 3 column array specifying a colormap (see COLORMAP for help). Particularly useful for 
	specifying a colour for each of N groups - pass CMAP an Nx3 array, each row specifying the color of a group. 

* [Further info] example_script.m now contains examples using all of these new features. It also contains code to 
	allow plotting of group order by total similarity within each group (as a measure of intra-group organisation)
