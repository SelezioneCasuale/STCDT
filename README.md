## The Spike Train Community Detection Toolbox

This repo hosts the current usable version of the Spike Train Community Detection toolbox developed by the Mark Humphries lab at the University of Manchester. Code included here implements the algorithms from _Humphries, M. D. (2011). Spike-train communities: finding groups of similar spike trains. The Journal of Neuroscience, 31(6), 2321-2336_ . A pdf of the paper is provided in this repo for reference.

Matlab, python (minimal but working) and Spark (notebook format, very developmental) version of the code are provided.

Each version of the code is at a different stage of development.

### Matlab:
Most stable. Version 1.2 released on 12.6.2011. Written by Mark Humphries. The code here mirrors that available [here](http://www.systemsneurophysiologylab.ls.manchester.ac.uk/code/analysis/ "Humphries lab website").

### Python:
A minimal implementation of the matlab example script written in 2013 by Thomas Sharp.

### Spark:
Developmental code for a large scale implementation of the algorithms, currently in development by Mathew Evans.
